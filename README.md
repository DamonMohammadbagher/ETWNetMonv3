## ETWNetMonv3 is simple C# code for Monitoring TCP Network Connection via ETW 
-----------------
"ETWNetMonv3.exe" is Windows App for read/watching ETW Logs (which made by ETWNetMonv3Agent.exe).

"ETWNetMonv3Agent.exe" is ETW Agent C# code and with this simple code you can have realtime TCPv4/v6 Connection Logs also with this tool you can Detect Meterpreter Payload via Signature But this Signature worked very well only on Msfv4 (tested on Kali 2018, msf v4.17) , Metasploit v6 (msf6) signature is chanaged so this old signature will not work on Msf6 ;)   

"ETWNetMon3Log.exe" is Command base tool for make XML/HTML report via "Queries" from ETW Logs (which made by ETWNetMonv3Agent.exe tool).
